--1) Using the WHERE clause with a simple equality operator
SELECT product_id, product_name, category_id, model_year, list_price
FROM production.products WHERE category_id = 1
ORDER BY list_price DESC;


--2) Using the WHERE clause with the AND operator
SELECT  product_id, product_name, category_id, model_year, list_price
FROM production.products 
WHERE category_id =1 AND model_year = 2018 
ORDER BY list_price DESC;


--3) Using WHERE to filter rows using a comparison operator
SELECT product_id, product_name, category_id, model_year, list_price
FROM production.products
WHERE list_price > 300 AND model_year = 2018
ORDER BY list_price DESC;


--4) Using the WHERE clause to filter rows that meet any of two conditions
SELECT product_id, product_name, category_id, model_year, list_price
FROM production.products
WHERE list_price > 3000 OR model_year = 2018
ORDER BY list_price DESC;


--5) Using the WHERE clause to filter rows with the value between two values
SELECT product_id, product_id, category_id, model_year, list_price  
FROM production.products
WHERE list_price BETWEEN 1899.00 AND 1999.99
ORDER BY list_price DESC;


--6) Using the WHERE clause to filter rows that have a value in a list of values
SELECT product_id, product_name, category_id, model_year, list_price
FROM production.products
WHERE list_price IN (299.99, 369.99, 489.99)
ORDER BY list_price DESC;


--7) Finding rows whose values contain a string
SELECT product_id, product_name, category_id, model_year, list_price
FROM production.products
WHERE product_name LIKE '%Cruiser%'
ORDER BY list_price;
